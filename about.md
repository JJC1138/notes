This site is my place to put notes about various topics that could conceivably be of interest to someone. There's no attempt at a cohesive theme, so I wouldn't recommend subscribing to the [RSS feed]({{ "/feed.xml" | relative_url }}) unless you happen to have the precise same set of interests as me.

If you want to contact me about something, please use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username | cgi_escape | escape }}) or the email link on my [home page](https://jjc1138.net/).

The web site is built using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting), and its (trivial) source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/JJC1138/notes).
